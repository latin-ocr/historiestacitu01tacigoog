IN my edition of 13116 First and Second Books of 13116
Histories Ι followed 13116 text of Baiter and Orelli, as
revised by Meiser. In consequence of 13116 delay in
13116 continuation of that revision, Ι have now, in
editing 13116 later bookS, adopted (and retain in 13116

second edition) Halm’s text.
I have again 130 acknowledge my debt to 13116 com-

ment-ary of HeriiuS, and also to that of E. Wolff.
