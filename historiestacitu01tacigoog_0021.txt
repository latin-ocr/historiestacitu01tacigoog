IN TROD U ΟΤΙ ON. xv

story of the war in the East-a brief sketch of
Jewish history since the Maccabean period, a general
description of Palestine, and a curious medley of

, traditione respecting the origin of the ‘ Chosen

People.' The war itself, previous to the siege of
Jerusalem, is scarcely touched, as indeed its main
incidents are outside the period of which the historiari
is writing. Although he has no sympathy with
Judaism, and regards the J ew simply as a strange
and unpleasing phenomenon, yet even a Roman must
have recognized that the contest was unlike any of
the wars which had built up the empire. The
enemies were no mere savages like the Germane, or
civilized nations whose day was over, like the Greeks:
for the first time Rome had to encounter a strong
and virile people and a fully developed national spirit.
Other nations might accept Roman customs and
allow themselves to be gradually permeated by
Roman ideas: but the national as well as the religious
feeling of the J ew made him at once an irreconcile-
able and a formidable antagonist. It is no wonder
that Tacitus should have done scant justice to the
Hebrew's long struggle to preserve his nationality
against Seleucid and Roman ε but we, with a fuller
knowledge of Jewish tradition and a better under-
standing of Judaism, may well regard the page that
records the last desperate resistance to an alien
domination as one of the most tragic in history.
