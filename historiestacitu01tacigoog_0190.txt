154 NOTES. III. OHAPS. 19-21.

7. plano: al. in plano, which is certainly more in accord·
ance with Latin usage3 but the simple ablative of place is not
uncommon in Tacitus, aq. 48, eodem latere sitam.

8. idem audaciae: cp. A. xiii. 16, idem aemi-9.
10. clementiam = samam clementiae.
12. sinu: on its metaphorical use, v. ii. 92, note.

15. ne cuiusquam according to Madvig’s rule for quie·

quam is more general and emphatic than ne cujus, ‘ no one
whoever’ (Madv. Lac. Gr. 494).

15, 16. rupturi ni ducantur z cp. 56, εἰ cmwulerentur vera dic-

turis. A conditional clause depending on a future participle
is hardly found before Livy.

XXI.

4, 5. sex...eserat‚ v. 14. Besides the six complete le 'ons
there were detachments from three other legione, and a orce
of cavalry. These troops cannot have come by the direct
route (via Postumia) or the Flavians would have already en-
countered them. It is suggested that they marched by the

via Aemilia (by Mutina and Parma), but this would have
taken them too far to the south.
