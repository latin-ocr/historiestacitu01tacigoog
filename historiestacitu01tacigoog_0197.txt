2. lixarum: on their usual character, v. ii. 87, procacis-
simis etiam inter servos lixarum inqeniia

3. in libidinem corruptior: in expresses the aim or
result. Cp. A. xv. 44, tamquam in saevitiam unius absumer-
entur (to gratify one man's cruelty).

7, 8. ubi incidisset, for the subjunctive cp. i. 49, ubi in
glolvgzsoessucidisset, and note on si mali forent, in the same

7. aut quis=aut aliquis: as if the pronoun were immedi-
ately preceded by ubi.

1οζ gravia auro dona: cp. Virgil's dona dehinc auro
yram.

13, 14. faces in manibus: Heraus and Wolff put only a
comma at eruere, and explain faces iu manibus as meaning
faces ‘manibus yerentes, which seems intolerably harsh, and is
supported by no really similar instance.

16. utque exercitu: on ut, v. i. 4 note. ‘ Exercitu ’ is an abla-
tive of attendant circumstances, a sort of abl. absolute ; cp. ii.

73, ut nullo aemulo,
19, 20. in ignem considerent: cp. Aen. ii. 624, ix. 144.

20. Montis, dea avertens molestiam odoris 9ravissimi, putoris,
qui ex corruptione ‘ , nascitur (Orelli); properi the
corruptio aeris or mal ‘m itself3 a deity whom the in abit-
ants of the banks f the Padus would find it only too
necessary to propitiate. An inscription dedicating an altar
to Mefitis has been found at Cremona.

For the common Italian deification of harmful agencies‚ cp.
ας). the invocation of Mildew or Blight in the Fasti of Ovid
(iv. 911), Aspera Bobiyo parcas Cerealibus herbis, etc.

[J osephus (Bell. Jud. iv, 11.) gives a very different account
of the battle and taking of Cremona. According to him the
Vitellians did not surrender; Antonius surrounded most of

the army and cut it to pisces, pursuing the remainder into
the town. 4500 Flavians and 30,200 Vitellians fell (J osephus
always deals in large numbers). It is needless to say that

Tacitus is the more trustworthy authority on Italian history]
