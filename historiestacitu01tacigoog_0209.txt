3. clementius, ἑο. where the ascent was gentlest, least
steep. Cp. Germ. 1, clementer edico juyo. Antonius os course
expected that the Vitellians would have occupied the ordinary
route (the via Flaminia).

5, 6. necterent moras: the same phrase, iv, 68. Cp. Aen.
iv. 51, caueae innecte morandi.

6. nimius, ‘ too powerful for them)
10. media, ‘ ambiguously.'

13. adversa abnueret, etc. ; ‘refuse responsibility for failure
or take credit for success.’

14. P. Griphum z mentioned again, iv. 39 (as praetor). It

18. volentia, in passive sense, ‘ welcome.' Cp. A. xv. 36,

vis peditum implies the shock of a solid body. Livy uses
ocella several times in this way; and there is a passage in

storm-cloud on the mountainS.
12. casum cremonaez a natural euphemism.

17. Daciam. Asiam is the reading of M, but it gives no
satisfactory sense, as we hear of no disturbance in Asia.
Halm’s reading is justified by the following, illis Moesiae
pacem ; although Daciam componere is a rather strange ex-
pression for the repulse of a Dacian inroad. cp. 46.

19. validissimam, stronfiest in any respect, whether mili-
tary force or natural wealt

LIV.
