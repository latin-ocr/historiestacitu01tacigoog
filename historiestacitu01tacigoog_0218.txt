182 NOTES. ΙΙΙ. CHAPS. 66, 67.

periculum and misericordia would refer to Vespasian. But
Orelli takes misericordia to mean the indignant pity of the
Vitellians for their deposed chief.

(Tiedke proposes ne victos quidem laturo—dative agreeing
with Vespasiano above—and su poses the sense to be ε Ves-
pasian would not have spared ltellius even as an enemy in
arms, and actually defeated, much less would he suffer him to
live as an influential citizen. But besides that this gives an
unnatural sense to privatus, Vespasian as a matter of fact is
spoken of above as the actual victor on the field.)

ll. Germameo, ii. 593 his death, iv. 80.

15. aemulatore redituram. M has aemulatore dituram.
Heraus reads aemulo redituram, on the ground that aemulus
is more common in Tac. than aemulator.

16, 17. casibus dubus reservamini, spared till success should
be assured, so that the Flavians might utilize Valens’ interces-
sion in the event of their defeat.

17. praegravem, ‘ an inconvenient burden.'

18. specimen paruum, ‘ the type of his party,' or its repre·
sentative man.

19, 20. non a caesare, etc. This is not historically accurate,
as neither Julius Caesar nor Augustus had actually caused
their rivals to be put to death. The argument is z if neither
Caesar nor Augustus had been genereus enou h to spare
their rivaIS‚ it was not likely that Vespasian wou d show this

enerosity towards a member of a family of which he had
een a dependant.

22. Vitem. L. Vitellius, the emperor's father: twice

. Claudius’ colleague in the consulship (43 and 47) and once in

the censorship (47-51); Suet. Va. 2, A. xi. 3; H. i. 52,
Vitellio tres patris consulatus.

29. per ludibrium, etc. The proposition seems to express
the circumstances attending their end ; whether they were to
meet that eud in the midst of mockery and insults or in the
doing of some brave deed:

μὴ μὰν ἀσπουδί ’γε καὶ ἀκλειῶς ἀπολοίμην
ἀλλὰ μέγα ῥέξας τι καὶ ἐσσομένοισι πυθέσθαι.

 

LXVII.

1. surdae ad. Cp. Liv. ix, 7, surdae ad omnia solacia aure-⁸.
Cic. Tusc. iii. 11, mentis ad omnia caecitas.

4. parens, on whom v. ii, 64. 89. Suetonius (Vit. 14) says
that scandal accused her son of hastening her death.
