17. Germanus, Upper and Lower Germany. The governor,
Hordeonius Flaccus, and the leyionis leyatus Vocula had
espoused Vespasian’s cause 3 iv. 31, 37.

19, 20. pacem victis uti-lia: cp. ii. 20, postquam pdx et
concordia speciosis et inritis nominibus iactata sunt.

24. summa rerum is a difficult phrase to translate3 some-
times it seems to mean ‘ the main issue ' (like res summa in
quo res summa loce, Aen. ii.), sometimes ‘ the general plan to
be adopted‚' as in 50 and ii. 81 ; here and in ii. 33, it may at

relative clause so abruptly introduced without an antecedent
verb of saying is apparently an imitation of similar Greek

constructione. For a ike abrupt chan e to oratio obliqua, cp.

et leyationes petivisse foedus. At the same time, it should be

remembered that the reading of M is cuius nimius ardor im·
parem esse, etc.

28. modestiam: apparently the sense is that Vitellius' coun-
sels of moderation were unable to check the soldiery.

description that the Flavians had occupied not only the Capi·
tolium proper, bnt also the building now known as the Tabu-
larium : for the Vitellians are described as making an nnsuc-
cessful attempt to force their wa into a building to the right
of the ascent, and separated rom that ascent by certain
