NOTES. III. GHAP. 71. 187

entrance from the side of the Forum, he adds, “ it seems prob-
able that this was the point at which the Vitellian rioters
in Ad). 70 broke into the Capitol (Tac. Hist. iii. 71).” What
the porticus dextrae subeuntibus were, is not very clear; the
existing remains of the porticus deorum consentium are said to
date from the Flavian era ; perhaps Tacitus wrote before they
virlere built, and is alluding to some old colonnade occupying
t e same site.

At any rate, the general idea of the attack is plain enough3
in order the better to defend the stronghold of the Capitolium
proper, the Flavians had occupied the buildings also on the
right of the ascent 3 and into these first, through or over the
intervening porticus, the Vitellians try to force their way. In
Capitolii sores penetrassent, the proper meaning of Capitolium
must be extended to the Tabularium.

14. tum diversos, etc. Baffled in their first attempt, the
Vitellians attack the Capitolium from two opposite points,—
on the one side from the lucus asyli, i.e. roughly s eaking,
the Piazza del Campidoglio ; on the other, from the irection
of the Tarpeian Rock, that is, apparently, from the south.
It seems probable that the Rupes Tarpeia was the escarp·
ment of the hill abutting on the Vicus Jugarius and the
Forum, therefore not the point now popularly known as the
Tarpeian Rock, which would not be visible from the Forum
at all. But modern buildings have made absolutely certain
identification impossible.

To ascend to the As lum, the Vitellians either climb the
Clivus Capitolinus (in w ich case, however, their attack would
scarcely be improvisa), or make a circuit by the yradue Mone-
tae at the east side of the hill. .

analogy of multo die, multa nocte.

· 19. ln altum edita: as the Capitolium proper stood about
fifty feet higher than the Asylum, the roofs of houses built

on the latter would naturally be about on a level with the
base of the temple. . ¹

justified by the fact that there is some trace of a word having
dropped out aftersama, and rather improves the sense: dum
