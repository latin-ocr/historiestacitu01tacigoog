192 NOTES. III. OHAPS. 75—77.

8, 9. inter omnes constiterit: the perfect subj. seems to
weaken the force of the assertion here and in ii. 76,- propius
suerit. The meaning is, ‘ all will probably agree) It appears
to be a kind of conditional sentence with protasis suppressed.

12.. ‹1:110me ‘ put an end t0.' Op. 81, dirempta belli com·
mercia.

14. sed resumes the narrative interrupted at the end of 74.

15. vicem reddens, ιζε. making Atticus a return for helping
him out of a difficulty.

18, 19. invidiam crimenque adgnovisse: sc. recognized· how
odious a deed it was, and how real a ground of accusation.
Heraus, however, compares it to prospera adquiesceret (52),
so that thus adqnovisse would mean, ‘ took upon himself the

responsibility . ’

LXXVI.
2. Feroniam, an Italian goddess of freedom apparently3

Liv. xxii. 1, the libertinae make her an offering. She had '

temples at Praeneste and on Soracte, and a third here spoken
of, three miles from Tarracina. Cp. Hor. Sat. i. 5, ora man·
usque tua lavimus, Feronia, lympha .· milia tam pransi tria
repimus atque subimus impositum saa-ie late candentibus Anxur.
Perhaps we should read apud Feroniae on the analogy of ad
Martis (Cic. ad Qu. Fr. iii. 7) and similar phrases.

Tarracinae ε cp. 57.

4. egredi moema. Notice the silver age construction of
egfredi with an accusative.

8, 9. noctu dieque. Some edd. suggest diuque, but the
alteration seems unnecessary.

9. fluxi, etc„ {reaming uncontrolled and waking the echoes
of the beautiful coast.’

personantes is used transitively as in Aen. vi. 171, forte
cava dum personat aequora concha.

LXXVII.

2. praesidium is used here in the sense of an armed force,
as in 78 (abscisis omnibus praesidiis) and iv. 56, pollicitus si
praesidium daretur iturum in Batavos.

3. tradsturum ι Μ has tradi suburam, which of course
respuit Latinitas as Orelli says.
