10, ll. cuncta pari formidine implicabantur, ⁴ here too all

same as the more usual misceri ; v. i. 38, note.

11. paganis, ‘ civilians,’ as in 43.

14, 15. ruentium. Nipperdey proposed irruentium, but the
alteration is unnecessary, as the simple verb is several times
used by Tacitus with the idea of blind headlong haste. Cp.
82, desperatione sola ruebant. In earlier writers ruere gener·
ally means to fan rather than to hasten. But Cicero more
than once uses it almost as a synonym of furere, as opposed
to consistere. Cp. Phil. ii. 10.

16. foedatus = foede laceratue. Vir il uses foedare in this
way3 Aen. ii. 55, ferro Aryolicas foedare latebras ; iii. 241,

Pauey. 8, allata erat ex Pannonia laurea ; Plin. A? Η. XV.
30, laur-{is Romanis praecipue laetitiae victoriarumque nuntia
additur itteris. ’

22. perdomandae campaniae insistere, ‘ to wait till he had
reduced Campania.) Cp. a somewhat similar use of the word

in ii. 46, insistere spei.
24. recens victoria, ‘fresh from their victory‚' ‘flushed with

success.' Earlier writers sometimes use recens a in this sense3
so Varro says, pullus a partu recens. Cp. Aen. ix. 455, recens

caede locus.

26. haud parva mole certatum, ‘ there would have been a
desperate conflict.' For moles in the sense of difficulty
(whence the use of molior, v. ii. 35, note) cp. 84, plurimum
molis iu oppuynatioue castrorum suit ; A. iii. 78, haud mayna
mole Piso promptus ferocibus in sententiam trahitur ,· Aen. i.
