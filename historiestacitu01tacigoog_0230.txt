194 NOTES. III. OHAPS. 77, 78.

28. quo modo in sentences of compat-ison is often used by
Tac. instead of quemadmodum, which is oommoner in other
authors; yet Cicero uses quomodo thus sometimes,

 

LXXVIII.

2, 3. festos sat-mm dies, beginning Dec. 17.

3. ocriculum, in Umbria, south of Narnia, near the con·
fluence of Nar and Tiber.

3, 4. causa ...utz cp. Cic. pro Font. 36, mayna cam

ablegffizsmclvissenm subjunctive e ressing the motive alleged
by the duces (‘since, as they sai ‚'-). Videbatur is in the
indicative because the· verb of· thinking is now actually
‘gg-aug, Ιιέξιινίένξξῗ sggjffissngffigessgsopomffi eils ffiffiply an
intentional 1rregularity.

16. ms cohortes, praetorias. As there were 16 praetorian
cohorte (ii. 93), and 14 had taken the field (iii. 55), we must
suppose that of these 14 Vitellius had brought one back to
Rome with him as his escort (v. 56); so that after six had
been detached under L. Vitellius seven would now be the
force at Narnia. Nipperdey solves the difficulty by altering
quattuordecim (55) to tredecim.

18. haud saeue, etc.: cp. 28, note.

20. praepostero, ‘ ill-timed ἐ the ablativo and dum with
the indicative here express the same thing—the reason wh

iam cannot well mean ‘ invidiam deusti Capitolii,’ for it was
exactl this calamity which Tac. alleges to have been brought

. represented as preceding the conflagration.

22, 23. nnem elus insignivere, ‘ made its end the more
remarkable ’ by the burning of the Capitol, etc.

24. transversis itineribus, etc.. Cerialis was to traverso by
cross roads the Sabine country lying between the via Flaminia
to the west and via Salaria to the east, and so enter the city
by the latter route, through the Colline gate. Plin. N. H.
xxxi. 7, sa s the ‘via salama was so called because it was the

route by w 'ch the Sabinos brought home their salt from the
city z not a convincing derivation.
