5. testudinem. Probably what is meant here is a movable
shcd, “a military machine moving upon wheels, and roofed
over, used in besieging cities, under which the soldiers
worked in undet-mining the walls or otherwise destroying
them’'; Dict. of Antiq. According to the same authority, “ the
name was also applied to the covering made by a close body
of soldiers who placed their shields over their heads to secure
themselves against the darts of the enemy. '' This would be
the testudo of iii. 27 and 28 (a ‘Schilddach’ as Orelli says,
while the shed in the present passage is a ‘ Schutzdach ²).

7. hausissent = perfuncti essent. Cp. the Greek use of
ἀντλεῖν in the same sense.

consummari, sc. this was the goal of all their labours.

12. inquietare, ‘ mai-,⁵

14. amplectebantur. It would be better to punctuate after
foedare, making the imperfect describe in a word the whole
scene of which the historic infinitives give the details; it

omes.

17. contrariis vulneribuS, ‘ with their wounds in front.’
C . Liv. ii 6, contrario ictu per parmam uterque transfixus.
ffith the next words one may compare Euripides' descrip-
tion of the death of Polyxena, πολλὴν πρόνοιαν εἶχεν εὐσχήμως
'trecen‘-

Dio (lxv, 19) sagrs that 50,000 men fell in the fighting of
these days ; consi ering the number of combatants, this looks
like an exaggeration.

20. per aversam Palatii partem, ‘ through the back of the
Palatium,' erha s through the Tiberiana domus, which
lay behind 13oe PafiatiuQ and on the opposite side to the part
of the city where most of the fighting would be going on.

ep. i. 27.

21. Aventinum is said by Heraus to be a gloss, based on 70
