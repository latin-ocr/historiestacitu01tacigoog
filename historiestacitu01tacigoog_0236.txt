9, 10. ni adsit vertuntur ; as vertuntur expresses that the
change is usual or likely to take place, and does not denote
any particular occurrence, the indicative can be used to
answer the subjunctive adsit. Cp. Plin. Ep. i. 8, ‘nec εἰ casu
aliquo non sequatur (yloria), idcirce, quod yloriam meruit,
minus pulcrum est.

ll. contineri: cp. i. 84, note on res militares continentur.
12. meruit, ‘ deserved,’ as in 78 (crimen meruit).

rel publicae, etc. The sense is: no doubt it was better

Such would be Caecina and Bassus3 ii. 100. On imputare
(‘make a merit of’) v. i. 38, note. ,

16. dle, poetical equivalent of ‘ sole.'

20. Caesarem, till Hadrian’s time the title borne by sons of
the reigning emperor.

22. deduxit: the soldiers escort Domitian home, just as in
republican times the successful candidate for office was accom-
panied to his house by a throng of friends. The custom
survives, but the citizen is superseded by the soldier.

definite person, cp. i. 85, animum mdcumque conversis.

would be assumed that tall young men were Germane who
had served in Vitellius' auxiliary cohorts. On the stature of
the Get-mans cp. v. 14 ε Germanos proceritas corporum etz-tollit.
