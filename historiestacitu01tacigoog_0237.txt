NOTES. IV. omps. 1, 2. 201

10. verterat ι Heraus and Orelli think the pluperfect indi·
cates the rapidity of the change (cp. ii. 73, proruperant and
note): but this is not necessary 3 the tense expresses the
motive, which is naturally anterior to the act (naluit usquam
secretum aut clau-sum sinebant).

13. si resisteretur : cp note on i. 49, si misor-ent.

13, 14. nec deerat ...prodere ε so iii. 58, nec deerat ipse...

elic-ere}3 For the various constructions with nec decrat, v. note
on 1. .

ultro: v. note on i. 7.

16. et fortuna: ει is interposed because fortuna is not merely
another item but a general summing-np of the situation.
One MS. has forma, which gives perhaps a better sense, but
there can be no doubt that fortuna is right.

19 temperandae notoriae impares, ‘ unable to make a
{1223}th use of their victory ’: cp. Cic. pro Marc. 8, victoriam

t÷II.dpa.x et quies: i.e. , it is only in peace that bonae artes find
a e .

 

II.

l. sedem caesaris, the Palatium 3 cp. iii. 86. This sentence
is somewhat complicated by what Orelli calls Tacitus' con-
tempt of the commonplace. We should expect the adversative
part to begin at nondum (sed nondum, etc. ), or else to have a
participle instead of ayebat: cp. 28, nec quievere Ubii quo
minus praedas e Germania peterent, primo impune, dein cir·
cumventi sunt ; where primo impune stands in the same loose
connection with the first part of the sentence as nondum ad
curas intentus in the present passage.

3. agebat, ‘played the part of ' ε cp. i. 30, cum amicum im·
peratoris ayeret.

praetorii: the praetorian cohorts were reduced by Ves-
pasian to their former number, nine.

10. reliqua belli: cp. the same expression, 51.
ll. Ariciam: cp. iii. 36.

12. intra Bovillas stetit, ‘ did not advance beyond Bovillae,
a town on the Appian way, ten miles from Rome.

23. prosperis is a kind of abl. abs. For the use of the neuter
cp. the same word in iii. 64.
