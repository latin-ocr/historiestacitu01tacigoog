struction‚ A. xi. 383. ¹ On the powers or inarily decreed to the
princeps, υ, i. 47, decernitur Othoni tribunicia potestas et
nomen Auyusti et omnes principum honores: and ii. 55 ou
Vitellius' accession. The usual decree would confer on the
emperor the tribunician power, title of Augustus, and pro·

consulare imperium. See also Fumeaux' introduction to his
ed. of Annals i-vi.

On the present occasion the Senatus consultum must have
been closely followed by the Lex de Imperio Vespasiani, of
{2¹13} a large part is preserved fn the Capitoline Museum at

15. Gallias, etc. Almost every province of the empire had
had its share in the wars of the last eighteen months ε Galba
and Vindex had led the armies of Gaul and Spain3 Vitellius’
starting point had been the Rhine, Antonius' Illyricum, and
Vespasian's the provinces of the East.

21. ea prima speeie forma. Vespasian’s letter must have
been written after the fall of Cremona, but before the death
of Vitellius : hence he writes in the tone of a eneral whose
enemy is still before him, but who is mora ly certain of
victory: and son-to those who look farther than the prima
species—he speaks as though the prize were within his grasp.

22. civffla, 220.. without undue assumption.
