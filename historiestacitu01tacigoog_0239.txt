NOTES. IV. GHAPS. 3, 4. 203

23. nec senatus obsequium deerat: senatus is a subjective
genitive. Several French translators have entirely mistaken
the sense, one rendering pariant du senat avec deference.

24. praetura, urbana: cp. Suet. Dom. i. honorem praeturae
urbanae consulari potestate suscepit titulo tenus ‚· nam juris·
dictionem ad colleyam proximum transtulit. Dom. no doubt
received the consulare imperium on account of the absence of
the two real consuls, his father and brother. The passage is
’ excellentl illustrated by a coin which bears on one side the

head of {espasian with the inser. mr. CAESAR vnsrAsrAnvs
Ave„ and on the other those of Titus and Domitian with
their respective titles of consul and praetor.

 

3. publice loqueretur, i. e. address the state council on mat·
ters of state. It was not customary for anyone except the
emperor to address an official letter to the consuls or senate.
Provincial governors must have written despatches relatin
to their provinces ; but Mucianus’ letter I suppose referret}

to the general political situation. Op. ii. 55, ‚qratior Caecinae
modestia suit, quia non scripsisset (ad senatum).

loqueretur ε the question being only “ rhetorical ’² we
should expect the accus. and infin.; but cp. 62, qui dua: viae.

4. loco sententiae, as we should say, ‘ from his place in the
house.' When asked for his sententia on any matter he might
eqredi relationem and say what he wished.

9. erant z the plural in such cases is usual in Tacitus. Cp.
note on inridebant, ii. 30.

10, 11. triumphalia, sub. insiynia: v. note on i. 79.

1 1. 'bello civium = bello civili.

Sarmatas: a Roman general could not have a triumphus
for a victory over his ‹munti-ymen, so the senate had to fall
back on the repulse of the Dacian raid described iii. 46.

12. consularia: cp. consularia ornamenta, i. 79. Consularis
“ under the empire became a mere title ior· the higlher class
of officere, who thereby obtained permlsslon to ave the
iniigflibssfiassfffssiss wissrhffi? iivssssshiss'ssnffegffl‘ ¹231} ‘²33¹ 1222}
{ilmses for the govenqlbrs of imperial provinces.

15. val. Asiaticus, Vitellius' son-in-law: i. 59.
