himself was consul perpetuus desimam ‚· there could thus oi

ning of the year 70.

The procedure in the Senate follows the ordinary practice3

on a difference of moral than of political ideal. Stoicism
did not necessarily regret the Republic; what it denou'nced

system. Indeed according to its strict doctrine the ideal
