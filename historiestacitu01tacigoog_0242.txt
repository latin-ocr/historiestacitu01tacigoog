206 NOTES. IV. σΗΑΡε4 6, 7.

9. egregiis utriusque orationibus: no doubt the speeches
would be aecessible to Tacitus, or at least they would sur·

vive in living memory.

14. eo senatus dle: a. good day’s workz yet we need not
suppose that the· passing of the decr-ee respecting Vespasian's ,
{3255'2‘21-30031123531 ffzssssssgsffleassssffssffik“ffiss‘zerz'sssr‘zssssz
emperors, ffioreovgv the senat-e had alreagdg ratified three
accessions within the last twelve months. eterum resumes ,
the interrupted narrative, like δ’ οὖν in Greek.

17. a magistr. iuratis: sc. by the consuls, who swore to
choose honestly.

VH.

1. rubor, a. picturesque equivalent for ‘ shame ' ε one might
paraphrase by ‘ personal vanity.'

3. altercationem: Cicero writes of such an altercatio with

his old enemy Clodius. Here it is opposed to continua
oratio, as in Liv. iv. 6, cum res a perpetuis orationibus in

altercationem vertisset.
6. quis multos anteiret: and so might expectto be selected.

13. aures imbuant, ‘ accustom him to hear': cp. iii. 15,
imbueretur.

14. Sorano, Barea Soranus, cons. design.52: for other notices
of him, cp. 10, 40, A. xvi. 21, 23 seqq. According-to the last
reference Nero virtutem ipsam excindere concupivit, interfecto
Thrasea Paeto et Barea Sorano: and the story of their
defence and death is told in the concluding chapters of Α.
xvi. Nothing is known of Sentius, apparently.

18. instrumentum: so in i. 22 the astrologers are called
‘pessimum principalis matrimonii instrumentum,’ the vilest
furniture of the palace.

21. praemiis: Eprius received 5 million sesterces for his
prosecution of Thrasea. (A. xvi. 33).

Notice the rhetorical turns in this chapter: such as the use
of anaphora (e. 9. the repetition of pertinere) and of
synonyme, sorte et urna, ete.
