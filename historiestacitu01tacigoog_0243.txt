two praefecti aerarii Satumi. Cp. Suet. Claud. 24, coueyio
quaestorum curam aerarii Saturni reddidit, quam medio tem-
pore praetores aut ‘uti nunc praetura suncti sustinuerant. The

administration of the treasury—since 28 13.c., when it was
separated from the quaestorship and entrusted to two praesset-i

aerarii who were chosen by the senate from the praetorii
—had undergone various changes. In 23 B.c., Augustus
caused two praetors to be chosen by lot, who bore the title
praetorii aco-atrii .· this system lasted till the reign of
Claudius, who in 44 (v. sup.) restored the aerarium to the
quaestore τ these officers were to administer it for three years
and then to take rank as praetors. without passing through
the otherwise necessary stages of the aedileship and tribunate.
