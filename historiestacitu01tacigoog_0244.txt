208 NOTES. IV. oms 9—11.

Under Nero the office was again held by praefecti, named by
the emperor himself from the praetorii: and after his
death, by praetores, as the present passage shows. Finally‚
Nerva or Trajan restored the Neronian system.

5. reservabat, ‘ was in favour of reserving it.’

6. perrogarent, sc. asking each senator for his vote: cp.
Liv. xxix. 19, perroyari eo die sententiae non potuerunt.

12. oblivio looks much more like an ablative than a
nominative: and is better taken as the former case, although
it is true that the singular form oblivium is nowhere else
found, and even the plural generally in poetry. Madvig and
Nipperdey would read oblivione.

meminissent: some remembered Helvidius' proposal—
by which Vespasian would only have played a secondary part
in the restoration —and informed the emperor of it.

1. P. Celerem, P. Egnatius Celer; v. A. xvi. 32, and Juv.
iii. 116, Stoicus occidit Baream delator, amicum discipulumque·
senex, ripa nutritus in illa ad quam Gorqonei apsa est pinna
caballi. Tac. describes im as a kind of Tartufe: habitu ec
ore ad exprimendam honesti imayinem exercitus, ceterum animo
perfidiosae, subdolus, avaritiam ac libidinem occultans. He
was a native of Berytus (or Tarsus, according to Juvenal).

3. ea cognitione, etc.: sc. “ although the prosecution was
thought to be an unadvisable reopening of old wounds, still
no one sympathised with Celer. Under the empire the senate
could try criminal cases, especially such as concerned
members of its own body: cp. for instance the case of Libo
in A. ii. and Piso in A. iii. In such trials the form of the
ordinary praetor's court was really preserved: the consul re·
prgsented the presiding praetor, and the senate the judex or
Ju ices.

7. promor corruptorque, etc. ε ‘ had betrayed and out·
raged that friendship which he professed to teach.'

8. dies, sc. day of meeting: cp. 40, when the case actually
comes on.

 

XI.

7. offensis, ‘ strained relations.'
8. nec deerat: v. i. 23, note.
