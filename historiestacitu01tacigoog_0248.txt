212 NOTES. IV. onus. 14, 15.

21. velut supremum = 16 meet no more: lit., as though for
the last time 3 the recruit bids farewell to his family as though

to the dead. Cp. Aen. iii. 68, mayna supremum voce ciemus.
For the adverbial use of the neuter, op. A. iii. 26, aeternum
mansere.

23. sensa, of course an exaggeration: cp. ii. 57, pauci
velerum militum iu hibernis relicti. It is not likely that any

of the rank and file were old men, properly speaking.

24. mama legionum nomina, either = legions which are so
only in name, or “legions crippled by the vaoancies in their
ranks” (lit., the vacancies of the legions), in which case
nomina is used in the same technical way as in ii. 57, ut
leyionum nomina supplerentur.

The first rendering is the best: more especially since, as a
matter of fact, the vacancies in the ranks had been filled up
(cp. 15, seynem numerum armis oneraverat), only they were
filled by raw recruits. Vitellius had taken 40,000 men from
the army of the Lower Rhine alone when marching to Italy:

6 . 1. l.
p25. {avosca-ent ε cp. iii. 56, vulnus pavens.

27. ne R. quidem: that is, the Flavian party, who would
be glad to see the attention of the Vitellian legions distracted.

cuius ambiguam, 616. Τ116 sense is: should the
Batavians be worsted (ambis). fort. is meiosis for ‘failure ’), at
least they could make a merit of the service they attempted
to render Vespasian. Should they succeed, their independence
would be vindicated‚ and they need give an account of their
actions to no one. The subject of imputatum-3 (on which v. 1.
38, 11616) is Batavos understood; some make it Romanos,
which gives no satisfactory sense. Thierry (Histoire des
Gaulois 3) renders the passage: Vaiucus, ‘nou-3 eu ferens
uu merite aupres de Vespa-sien .· vaiuqueurs, qui viendra nous

demander des comple-3 ?

XV.

2. patriis exsecrationibus. According to Grimm’s Deutsche
Rechtsalterthumer (quoted by Orelli), anything was good
enough for a German to swear by ; they swore per deos, per
sancta pumera, per humum, yramen, arbores, aquas, sontes,
fluvios, monbec, rupes, lapides, pectus, barbam, capillos, caput,
vestimenta, plerumque per arma et praecipue yladium.

adigit. Exsecrationibus takes the place of the sacramento
or Jurejurando‚ which usually follows this word.
