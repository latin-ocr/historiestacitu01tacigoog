NOTES. IV. οΗΑΡ. 17. 215

17, 18. ne Vindicis aciem cogitarent, sc. let them not think
that they should be warned by the failure of Vindex (coyicare

Introd. to Books 1 and 2.
18. Δοᾱιιοε, between the upper Loire and the Saone.

19. Arvernos, in Auvergne. Vindex was supported by the
Sequani in addition to the two last-named tribes.

Verginii: υ. Introd. to Books 1 and 2.

Belgas, Treveri and Lingones (69). Tac. says (i. 8)
that Galba refused the communities of Eastern Gaul certain
privileges granted to the others, and even mulcted some of
part of their territory : so that here the seeds of discontent

would be already sown.

231. repggantlbus = si quis reputaret: cp. note on the same
wo , 11. .

21. easdem omnium partes, ‘ they were all on the same

’ side.'

23. echome, the eight Batavian cohorte above mentioned.

qulbus: cp. A. i. 59, sibi* tres leyiones procubumm dat.
on analogy perhaps of abl. with a or simple‘abl. after intrans.

nuper, April 69, at the first battle of Bedriacum ε ii. 43.

multos adhuc, etc., of course au exaggeration: it was
95 years since the last census of Gaul, in Augustus' seventh

consulship.

26. nuper certe caeso Q. Varo, about 60 years before.
Nuper is thus a little surprising, more especially as it is used
a few lines back to describe an event of the same year : but it
is a word of rather loose signification, and denotes a less

degree of nearness in time than modO. Cp. Ciccr0, De Natura
Deorum, 2. 50, Nuper, id eet paucis ame saeculis.

31. proinde: cp. note oni. 21.

vacui occupatos, ‘while your hands are free and theirs
are tied ’ by the civil war. Rome's difficulty was the

Batavian's opportunity.
