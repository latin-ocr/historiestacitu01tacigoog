2. simul epulum, ἅμα δειπνοῦντες.
6. insigma, ornaments. Cp. 46, suis cum insignibus armisque.

7. misceri cuncta, etc.; lit. bade all be confounded in
darkness and the din of arms, ‘ add the confusion of darkness
to their attack.' Cp. the description ianhuc. iii. 23 of the
nocturnal sally of the besieged Plataeans.

8, 9. concursus incerti: M has corsus incertti, written in

the margin. (Iasus is 'more probable, though concursus makes
better sense.

10, 11.. tendere artus: M has arcus, which seems improb-
able. Orelli suggests acrius.

11. fors cuncta turbare, ‘ chance ruled the chaos.’

2. praetoriae portae. This gate adioined the praetorium
(quarters of the commanding officer and his staff), and was
commonly on that side of the camp which was nearest to the
{emmau ῑῑεΡεῑῑέ ἒεεῗὲΐεὲὲ &ffebgrfflzs‘ffi‘jzfflgnss‘s
the camp is a low lateau‚ gradually descending to the Niers,
a tributary of the euse. The porta decumana on the east
side faced the Rhine ε the river would make an attack from
this quarter less probable.

8. suspensum et nutans machinamentum, ‘ a crane balanced
and ready to descend.' What is meant is a εοίἰεπο, or balanced
beam with a rising and falling or seesaw movement ε one arm
would be within the camp while the other projected over the
ἷέΐέἰῖῗὶωῖἔὶέἓ &2521ssssssbsszzssssssffdanffl,350351212‘533
one or more of them was raised agam by the weightin of the
other end of the beam (verso pondere, lit. by the shi ting of
the weight) ι and apparently in its upward course it so swung
round as to de osit its victims within the camp. An age of
Gatlings and ordenfeldts finds it hard to realize the ‘ terror '
inspired by this incredibly clumsy device ἔ

Vegetius (iv. 21) says, ‘ Tolleno dicitur quotiens una trabes in
terram praealte deflyitur‚ cui in summo vertice alia transversa
trabes lonyior dimensa medietate connectitur, eo libramento, ut
si umcm caput depresseris, aliud ὡραίαν]
