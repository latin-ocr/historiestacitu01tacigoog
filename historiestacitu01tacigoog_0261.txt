NOTES. IV. OHAPS. 30—32. 225

11. expugnandi ε Μ has obpuynandi, which is probably
right, although the sense is not quite so good.

13. convellens, ‘ endeavouring to undermine.'

 

XXXI.

1. ante Cremonense proelium, thus before the end of Octo·
ber, 69. (So far Civilis is besiegin Vetera, Vocula and
Herennius are at Gelduba, Flaccus at ovaesium.)

3. caeduae edicto, sc. consulari ,· published probably at

Cremona. No doubt it urged the army to follow the example
of the consul and change sides.

4. Alpinius Montanus: cp. iii. 35.

8816ἑί ΞΘ §²²¹⁸ militia sine adfectu, ‘who had no heart in their

10, 11. non vultu neque animo satis adfirmans, ‘ without
show or feeling of sincerity.'

11, 12. iuris iur. verba conciperent, ‘ repeated the formula
of the oath ’; concepta verba means a prescribed form of words,
and concipere verba is apparently used in the sense of repeat·
ing such a form ε cp. 41, senatus inchoantibus primoribus jus
jurandum concepit.

12. vespae. nomen, etc. The sentence contains a zeugma ε

14. nutris, Pauli: cp. 13.
vincula: cp. 13. and i. 59.

16, 17. servientium animae, ‘ servile souls ' ε animae seems
to imply that the Treveri are regarded only as so man lives
at the Romans’ disposal. There is the same idea in irgil,
Aen. xi. 372, nos animae υἰῐεε, inhumata infletaque turba ster·
namur campis.
