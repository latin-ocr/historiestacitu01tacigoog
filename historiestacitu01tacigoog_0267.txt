NOTES. 1v. omps. 39, 40. 231

13, 14. recentes...fama, a kind of hendiadys ι ‘crowned with
fresh laurela’ Orelli thinks that recentes means novi (in the
well-known sense of parvenus) and Louandre translates
hommes nouveaax. But the e ithet would here be out of place,
and moreover there seems to no authority for this meaning

of recens.

16. Β. crassum, elder brother of Galba’s adopted son, and
so fratem imayine fulyens (ennobled by his brother's distinc-
tions) ; cp. i. 15, where Galba says to Piso, est tibi frater pari
nobilitate, natu major, digmus hac fortuna ‘nisi tu potior esses.
There is a similar use of imayo (the mask or bust of a member
of the family, preserved in the atrium with a list of the vari-
ous honores attached) in cessisti Galbae imayinibus (ii. 76).

19, 20. corrumpi facilis, instead of the Ciceronian facilis ad
commpendum. The infin. indicates the s here of action of
the adjective: cp. Horace’s celerem sequi an quidlibet impotens
sperare.

20. adeo ε υ. note on i. 9.

23. cl. Rufi: cp. notes on i. 8, and 11. 65, and note at end of
Ed. of Bks. Ι. and 11. From ii. 65 it appears that 01. Rufus
was retained near 'Vitellius' person but allowed at the same
time to hold his governorshi ι we may suppose however that
with the change of emperors is discessus had its natural result,
and the province was without a governor.

24. tribunatus, sc. militum, apparently a lucrative post: cp.
J uv. i. 58, cum sas esse putet cwram sperare cohortis qui bona
donavit praesepibus, etc.

s {rraefectusscaffi commands of auxiliary troops, praefecturae
a orum, e .

25. inanem animum, ‘ his vanity.’

26. in hiberna, in Pannonia: cp. ii. 86. The septima was
the septima Galbiana.

1028. tertia, Gallica: its headquarters were in Syria: cp. i.

29. in Germaniae, against Civilis.

30. egesto quidquid turbidum, ‘ after the removal of elc-
ments of disturbance.’

31. leg-ss, i.e. the laws regained their authority.

 

XL.
