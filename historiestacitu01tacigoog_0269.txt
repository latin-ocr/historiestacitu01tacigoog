NOTES. IV. GHAPS. 40, 41. 233

Pliny says of him Junius Mauricus, quo viro nihil fimi-us,
nihil verius (Ep. iv. 22).

25. comment. principalium, minutes of the imperial
cabinet, but apparently regarded as State documenta and
not the property of the individual emperor: the would
contain, inter alia, entries relatin to applicatione or leave
to prosecute. There are severa? mentions of such com-
mentarii in the history of the early empire‚ from the com-
ment. Caesaris of which we hear so much in Cicero’s
Philippics ; cp. ay. A. xiii. 43, eam orationem Caesar cohibuit,
compertum sibi referem εει· commentariis patric sui nullam
cuju-squam accusationem ab eo coactam.

27. tali super re: cp. 82, super rebus imperii. Cicero uses
cuper in this sense once or twice, only in letters,

 

XLI.

l, 2. iusiurandum concepit means either ‘ framed a form of
oath' or ‘ repeated a set form ' (for which latter sense cp. 31
and note on conciperent): the second meaning best suits
incllzloantibus ,· the leading men were the first to take the
oat .

2, 3. ceteri ut sententiam rogabantur ε this may perhaps
imply that mayistracuc from quaestore upwards gave their
opinione without bein asked by the presiding consul or
praetor ; v. Nipp. on Ag. iii. 17.

7, 8. probabant religionem etc. This is a difficult sen-
tence, and has caused some difference of opinion among com·
mentatore. The best meaning hitherto suggested is, I think,
that which approves itself to Orelli. According to his view
the words refer to those quic flagitii comcz‘entza inerat .· the
senate watched the embarrassment of these persons, and non
sine quadam ironia gave them all praiee for their well-meant
but futile attempts to make the oath fit their consciences;
but they held them for perjurers all the same. On the other
hand, Heraus makes probabant arquebant„ a description of
the whole ceremony: as each senator took the oath, the
house applauded his good saith or protested against his
