journey from the. coast.

mide. For the abl. cp. fecunda rumoribus, l. 51.

valet adqredi de re ardua, hostili, periculosa (Walther).

2. ferunt. Halm’e correction of MS. dicebatur ,· Ῑ do not
know why adopted, aa the construction is common enou h in
Tacitus: cp. iii. 79, plebem armari nuntiabatur. “ t is
shrewdly remarked by Roth that verba sentiendi et declar-
andi in the passive are found with accus. and infin. when the
matter is certain3 with nomin. and infin. when it is un-
certain '’ (Bach a . Orell.) From such instances as I have
observed, I ehoul think this distinction is rather fanciful.
