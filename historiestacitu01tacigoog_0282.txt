15. Galbam ct intractu. tributa, ‘ Galbas' reduction of the
tribute.' As a matter of fact Galba had made no reduction in

the case of those Gauls whom Vocula was now addressing: cp.
i. 8, proximae Germanicis exercitibus Galliarum civitates non

codem honore habitae, quaedam etiam finibus ademptis. So i.
53, Treveri et Linyoncc quaeque alias civitate-s atrocibus edictis
aut damno finium Galba perculerat.

Wolff reads ‘ post Galbam,' when the subjectvof induisse

would be cos.
16. quia z on the omission of ‘ sit ’ v. i. 21 note.

22. Romani exercitus. M Romanus exercitus .· which Or.
makes subject of iun-arent. Al. Romania exercitibus.

6. tas armorum, earlier writers would say ius belli .· it means
much the same as ius hostium.

13. socfl saepe nostrl, e.9. the garrisons of Saguntum and
Casilinum in the Punic wars.

14. pertulerunt with acc. and inf. is a usage of the silver

25. trahendi, absolute, ‘ gaining time.' Cp. Virgil, Aen.
vii. 315, at trahere atque τηοναε tantis licet addere rebus.

27. sane ego displiceant ‘ sane ’ has a concessive force here
as often (so it is frequently answered by tamen) .· “it is true,
perhaps I am unpopular.'' Cp. Cicero Tmo. ii. 14, nc sit canc
summum malum dolor .· malum certe est.

28. ne hoc, et-c. The connection with the last clause appears
to be, ‘⁸ you have other officere—choose whom ou will as
leader, only do not let Civilis lead you against Ita y. '’

32. wuston, a sort of dativus commodi.
