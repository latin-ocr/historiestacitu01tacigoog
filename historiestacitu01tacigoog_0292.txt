256 NOTE'S. IV. CHAPS 71, 72.

21. tertiis casm: from Mainz to Riol or Rigodulum is
about 27 hours' march. The road from Bingen to Trier led
throu h the ‘Soonwald ' and over the Hunsruck (the range
of h· lying between the Rhine, Moselle, and Nahe) past
Stromberg to Neumagen on the Moselle. ·

Rigodulum. About 9 miles below Trier, the hills re-
eeding from the right bank of the Moselle form a semicircle
in which lie the villages of Longwich and Ri01= the latter
standing back from the river actually where the hills begin
to ascend, and flanked on the west (the side nearest to Trier)
by a low projecting spur now covered with corn-fields and
orchards (the aequiora iuya of Tacitus). Valentinus had
occu ied this village, and as he no doubt expected to be
attae ed from the river bank, b which the Romans were
advancing· from Neumagen, he hat? strengthened his position
on that side by fossae obices ue saxorum. But Cerialis did
not only make a direct attac on these entrenchments: his
cavalry rode some little way up the hills lyin to the rear of
Riol, and from thence charged down on the reveri, who had
manifestly left this side unfortified. Then either from the
heights or from the river bank a detachment was sent byway
of the ‘ gentler ascent ' to cut off the enemies' retreat west-2
wards towards Trier. ·

Evidently Valentinus had only partially fortified his posi-
tion; but it is stran e that—if Riol exactly corresponds to
Rigodulum—he shoul have left it unprotected on the'side of
the montes, which are here not particularly steep.

23. montibus aut Mos. amne: tle. on one side by the heights,
on the other by the river.

29. praevenuntur (the nomin. is equites), ‘were exposed
t0‚' ‘were running the gauntlet of’: i.e. while the cavalry
were making a detour up the hill so as to gain a point of
vantage behind Riol, their flank would necessarily be exposed
to the enemy's missiles: cp. ii. 2, laeva maris praevectus.

31. aequioribus iugls, ‘ up a gentler ascent.'
32. Romamn, sc. Treverorum et Dinqonum.
in quis: Cicero and Caesar would say ‘ in his.'

1. coloniam Treverorum: Trier. It was founded by Nero
or Claudius, and was in later times the capital of the pro-
vince ‘ Belgica prima,' and a residence of Roman emperors ε

hence called by Ausonius (Mosella, 380) imperii aedes. At
