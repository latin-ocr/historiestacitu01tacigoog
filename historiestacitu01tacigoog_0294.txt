256 NOTE'S. IV. omps 71, 72.

21. tertiis metris: from Mainz to Riol or Rigodulum is
about 27 hours' march. The road from Bingen to Trier led
throu h the ‘ Soonwald ' and over the Hunsruck (the range
of h· lying between the Rhine, Moselle, and Nahe) past
Stromberg to Neumagen on the Moselle. ·

Rigodulum. About 9 miles below Trier, the hills re-
ceding from the right bank of the Moselle form a semicircle
in which lie the villages of Longwich aud Riol= the latter
standing back from the river actually where the hills begin
to ascend, and flanked on the west (the side nearest to Trier)
by a low projecting spur now covered with corn-fields and
orchards (the ' iuya of Tacitus). Valentinus had
occu iedthis ⁶ e, andashe no doubte tedtobe
attac ed from the river bank, b which the mans were
advancing from Neumagen, he huf strengthened his position
on that side by fossae obices we saxorum. But Cenalis did
not only make a direct attac on these entrenchments: his
cavalry rode some little way up the hills lying to the rear of
mol, and from thence charged down on the Treveri, who had
manifestly left this side unfortified. Then either from the
heights or from the river bank a detachment was sent by way
of the ‘ gentler ascent ’ to cut off the enemies' retreat west-⁴
wards towards Trier. Δ

Evidently Valentinus had only partially fortified his posi-
tion ; but it is sti-an e that—if Riol exactly cot-responde to
Rigodulum—he shoul have left it unprotected on the side of
the montes, which are here not particularly steep.

23. montibus aut Mos. amum i. e. on one side by the height&
on the other by the river.

29. praevehuntur (the nomin. is equites), ‘were exposed
t0‚' ‘were running the gauntlet of ἐ i.e. while the cavalry
were making a detour up the hill so as to gain a point of
vantage behmd Riol, their flank would necessarily be exposed
to the enemy's missiles: cp. ii. 2, laeva maris praevectus.

31. aequioribus iugis, ‘ up a gentler ascent!
32. Romamn, sc. Treverorum et Dinqonum.
ln quis: Cicero and Caesar would say ‘ in his.'

1. coloniam Treverorum: Trier. It was founded by Nero
or Claudius, and was in later times the capital of the pro-

vince ‘ Belgica prima,' and a residence of Roman emperors:
hence called by Ausonius (Mosella, 380) impedi aedes. At
