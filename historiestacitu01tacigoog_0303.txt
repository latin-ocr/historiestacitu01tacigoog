NOTES. IV. OHAP. 86.v V. GHAP. l. 265

5. traditurus foret = tr. esset .· a substitution which shows
how completely the future sense offorem had been lost. Livy
too has saturum soret (xxii. 57) and similar instanees.

8. temperamento, sc. he tempered‚ ehecked his desires:
but Wolff apparently takes it in the sense of ‘ disposition:
making it an attribute of Cerialis.

9. elusit, ‘ parried his proposal.’

12, 13. in altitudinem conditus, ‘ shrouding himself in a pro-
found reserve.’ Suetonius (Dom. 2) says eimutavit et ipse mire
modestiam imprimisque poeticae stadium tam insuetum antea
eibi quam postea spretam et abjectum. Quintilian's more fav-
ourable judgment carries the less weight as it was wrung from
him ab infausta necessitate, as Orelli says z Germanicum Aa·
9ustum ab institutis stadiis deflexit cara terrarum, parumque
dis visum est, esse eam maa-imum poetarum. Quid tamen sub-
limius, doctius, ete. (x. 1). The same sort of flattery is to be
found in Martial‚ Sil. Italicus, and the elder Pliny.

16. eontra interpretabatur, ‘ put on it an entirely different
construction ’z so practically ‘ misunderswod’
