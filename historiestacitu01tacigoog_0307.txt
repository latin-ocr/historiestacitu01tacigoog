NOTES. V. CHAP. 4. 269

4. animalis, the wild ass. This introduction of the ass into
Jewish tradition and worship may possibly have arisen from
a confusion of Israelitish migration with the Egyptian legend
of the seven days’ flight of Typhon on an ass ε Plutarch in-
deed distinctly says that the myth of Ty hon is by some
interwoven with the beginnings of Jewish istory‚ but that
it is a mere confusion (De Iside et Geir-ide, 31). According
to Diodorus, Antiochus Epiphanes saw in the Temple at Jeru-
salem a figure of a man riding on an ass, and supposed it to
represent Moses.

6. caeso ariete = et arietem caedunt. Egyptian art repre·
sented Ammon· as a horned deity. For these sacrifices cp.
Leviticus‚ xvi. 3. From this point to the end of the chapter
Tacitus is right in his facts ε but his explanatione are wrong.

8. memoria cladis z M has merito cladis.

10. crebris ieiuniis ε Moses instituted only one yearly fast,
on the great day of expiation, the tenth day of the seventh
month: but many others were afterwards introduced. The
Pharisees ‘ fasted twice in the week.’

11. raptarum frugum argumentumz for the right reason
for this v. Deuteronomy, xvi. 3.

12, 13. septimo die otium: Tacitus is confusing the ordina
Sabbath with the seven days' Feast of Tabernacles, whic
did commemorate the desert sojourn.

14. septimum annum z on the J ewish sabbatical year, v.
Leviticus, xxv. 4.

17. Saturno: the Greeks and Romans had adopted the
Egyptian custom of naming days after the lanets, and the
day of Saturn corresponded to the Jewish Sa bath.

20. feratur robably means ‘ moves,' and is not equivalent
to credatur, w ich latter word would be out of place in con·
&vegetiori with so well known a fact as that implied in altissimo

21, 22. septenos per numeros compleant. M has septimos
per numeros commearent .· Orelli following most Mss. reads

septimos per numeros commeare (Meiser commeent). Other sug·
gestione have been comiciam and coniciant, and viam for vim.

The late Mr. J. H. Onions doubted the genuineness of the
whole clause (Journal of Philoloqy, 1889). “ Commeare can
hardly be right, as it is beyond all doubt that celestial bodies
do move in multiples of seven, and Tacitus would not be likely
to mention this as a mere theory introduced by serunt. In
