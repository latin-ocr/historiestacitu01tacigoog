father’s will z super nmnerum pacm· vel gratum vel destinatum
sive post testamentum sactum save ex secundo matrimonio ’
(Heraus) : Greek, έπίγονος. Cic. de Or. i. 57, constat aqna-scendo
rumpi testamentum. Cp. Germ. 19, numerum liberomm finire
aut quemquam ex aynatis necareflayitium habetur. Precautions ,
against the birth or survival of such children were not a
‘flaqitium ' in Roman eyes. ’

16. suppliciis peremptorum: provided they be marty-rs for
their country or religion.

17. condere, etc. Condere of course goes with e more
Aegyptio: eademque cura means that the Jews treat the
dead in the same way ε not strictly true, as the J ewish custom
was not to ‘ mummify ' the body, but to anoint it with spices.
Cp. St. John, xix. 40, ἔλαβον οῦν τὸ σὼμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ καὶ ἔδησαν
αὐτὸ ὀθονίοις μετὰ τῶν ἀρωμάτων, καθὼς ἔθος ἐστι τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις
ἐνταφιάζειν. Heraus reads, condere quam cremare e more

Aegyptio cura, eademque est de infernin, etc. The sense is
very much the same. Burning of dead bodies was not recog·

nised by Mosaic law. Under the kings it was mmmmm-f, hut
appears never to, have been practlsed after the Baby oman

captivity. (Another reading is condire.)

ὁαὲθ. caelestium: a variation of construction, for de caelesti·

21. mente sola: Tacitus at least gives no evidence oi hold-
ing the common belief that the Jews worshipped the sky:
ἔΐῖᾱυέἷζὲνῗέξᾜῗιέἔέηῗὲῗέ ἐῖιῖὀᾼῖἕ. ἒὲἕὲ. Μὲἷῗαῖἀηηωῗῗέῑ
deor-amque nominibus appellant secretum illud quod sola rever·
entia vident (speaking of the Germans).

profanos means here ‘ rofane’·or ‘ impious'= the com·
moner word would be ‘ ne arios! ·

28. vitis aurea, mentioned by Josephus (Bell. Iud. 5. 5),
as having βότρυες ἀνδρομήκειςε also Antiq. Jud. 15. ll.

29. Liberum: this extraordinary fancy is supported by
Plutarch (Sympos. 4, 6).

32. absurdus sordidasque, ‘ uncouth and mean.'

 

VI.

2, 3. ab occasu Phoenices t west, not of J udaea proper, but
of Galilee, which Tacitus includes under the name J udaea.
