attack on three sides almost impossible: to the north-west
the city was protected‚ as Tacitus says, by not one, but ,χ
several lines of fortification. From the text we should infer
three concentric lines of wall. This would be quite a wrong
conclusion3 but Tacitus’ expression is justified by the fact
that an army, in order to make itself master of the entire
city, must gain three or even four walls. There were “four
distinct towns, each requiring a separate siege'’ (Milman).
Within the first wall lay the suburb of Bezetha. Immed-
iately to the south of this lay Aera (the lower rt of the

Epimanes, ‘ the madman ’ ε he reigned 176-164 13.o. His con-
sistent ersecution of the Jews aroused the resistance of the
heroic accabaean or Hasmonean family, with whom Antio·
chus waged an unsuccessful war. Tacitus pays but scanty
tribute to the J ewish patriots’ magnificent struggle against
the persecutor of their religion and profaner of their temple 3
as usual his sympathies are with any enemy of the hated
race.

The mention of Arsaces' revolt is a chronological mistake,
the revolt in question being contemporaneous with the reign
of Antiochus ΙΙ., called Θεός (who reigned 260-245 Β.ο.). The
confusion is not unnatural‚ as Antiochus Epiphanes appears
also to have been entitled Θεός, though not as a standing

designation.
