11. nflnl exspectato Caesare, ‘ without waiting for the deci-
sion of Augustus,’ who undertook to decide between the rivals
who contended for the throne after Herod's death (13.0. 3). By
the imperial arbitration Herod's kingdom was divided between
three of his thirteen children: Archelaus received Judaea,
Idumaea, and Samaria 3 his brother Herod Antipas, Galilee
and Peraea 3 his stepbrother Phili , the territory east of the
J ordan—Gaulonitis‚ Batanaea, Trac onitis, Ituraea, Auranitis.
Nine years afterwards, Archelaus was de osed and banished
by the Emperor, and J udaea and Samaria ecame temporarily
a Roman province, governed by an imperial procurator.

Simo established himself at the head of a band of
robbers in the glen between Jerusalem and J ericho, and called
himself king of Israel. The propraetor of Syria mentioned
here is probably that Varus who lost his army and his life
twelve years later in the Teutoburg forest.

16. arma potius sumpsere: although Caligula's mad pre-
sumption had driven the Jews to despair, it does not appear
that they actually took up arms. From the more detailed
account of J osephus‚ we learn that Petronius the governor of
Syria took upon himself to disobe the imperial command, and
to intercede with the emperor3 ut there can be no doubt
that he would only have ruined himself by his generosity, had
it not been for the opportune fall of Caligula.

Herod Agrippa 1.‚ a grandson of Herod the Great, and a per-
sonal friend of Caligula, not only succeeded to the Trans-
J ordanic territories of Philip, but contrived to secure for him-
self the tetrarchy of Galilee and Peraea, Herod Antipas, his
uncle, being driven into exile (Milman‚ ii. 141, 167, 168). In

tricts of J u aea and Samaria, which had for more than thirty
years been a Roman province (Milman‚ ii. 192). But he did
not long enJ'oy his elevation ι in 44 as he was presiding at a
great festival, ‘⁶ the angel of the Lord smote him, because he
gave not God the glory t and he was eaten of worms, and gave
up the ghost ’⁹ (Acts xii). He left a young son who succeeded
only to his uncle's territory of Chalcis ε this he was afterwards
allowed to exchange for the lands east of the Jordan. J udaea,
Galilee, Samaria, and Peraea became for the future a Roman

province.
