15ῗῇ ῙΞΞῙἩΝΒ, according to ch. i. the 3rd, 5th, 10th, l2th,
, n .

5. longius ausuri exactly translates ‘ to venture further ἰ
but one would expect lonyim proyredi ausuri.

6. cohortibus, sc. auxiliarieS.

6, 7. ambigue: in fact Titus was once cut off from the
main body of his army ε Jos. Β. J. ν. 2.

8. proelia serebant, a phrase formed apparently on the
analogy of manus conserere.

11. tamem hostium opperiri: cp. terya hostium promittens,
a similar substitution of subst. for verb, 18.

12. virtate, ‘ deliberate valour‚’ distinguished from ferocia,
ardour or high spirit.

14. morari is best taken transitively (Hierosolyma morari
Zengggsidebantur) z although Orelli says it is for nimis diu ei

15. melea, massive walls. Blocks of stone, 20 feet long by
4, high, are still to be seen here and there.

416. duos colles: according to Orelli these hills are Aera and
Zion. But the elevation of Acra was far lower than that of
Mount Moriah, immediately south of it 3 and in fact Tacitus is
evidently describing Acra and Zion at the end of the chapter,
when he speaks of alia intus moenia reqiae circumtecta.
According to Heraus the hills are Aera and Bezetha: but

town were not in immemum edita.

Probably duos colles is a general description of the city,
divided as it is into two main heights, Zion and Moriah. The
muri will then be the line of wall surrounding all the city:
after this general sketch of the coup d’oeil, the historian
described the fortifications lying behind the outer line—the
alia moenia and the Temple.

18. obliqui, etc., “ with projecting or retreating angles,’' so
that the flanks of attacking parties would be exposed to the
besieged. Cp. Veget. iv. 2, si quis ad murum calz ordinatione
constructum vel scalas vel meltinas voluerit admovere, non
solum a fronte sed etiam a lateribus ec prope a teryo in sinum

comba-sus opprimitur.

24. turris: on which v. Milman, iii. p. 17. There were
altogether 164 towers on the walls.
