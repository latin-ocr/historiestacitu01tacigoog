NOTES. V. OHAPS. 12, 13. 281

Simon is called by J osephus ‘ son of Gioras‚’ so that the
words quem et Barywram vocabant must be a mistake ε perhaps
they should either be placed after ‘ Simo ’ or omitted altogether
as a mistaken gloss: Baryiorasz bar Giora, Gioraefilius. John
was the son of Levi. Simon survived the destruction of J eru·
salem, and was brought to Rome to grace Titus’ triumph, as
dhe bravest of the J ewish leaders, after which he was put to

eath.

15. Ioannes = he had taken refu e in Jerusalem after the
capture of his native town Gisc ala, and thenceforward
headed the party of desperate resistance ιο ι116 Roman arms.
The media urbs which he held was the Tower of Antonia and
Mount Moriah, with the exception, so far, of the inner court
of the Temple, which was as yet occupied by Eleazar at the
head of the original J ewish war party z whereas John relied

· principally on the support of Galilean refugeeS.

17. armis: John was in possession of military engines,
perhaps those of the rouoed army of Cestius ε υ. 10.

20. per speciem sacrificandi, at the feast of the Passover.
According ιο Tacitus, evidently some of the zealots were
obtruncata .· J osephus does not mention this, simply saying

{1113 John sent a force and intimidated the zealots ιῑιιο joining

 

XIII.

1. prodis-la t J osephus mentions among other prodigies that
a ossglfissetpgzlzgngggffgoffytgfe fflfsssptfiat of one J esus, son
of Ananus. For seven years before , the capture of the city
this man had cried continually in the streete, “ Woe, woe ιο
Jerusalem !’' and had only been saved from punishment by
the popular opinion that he was a harmless maniac. At last
during the siege he suddenl cried, “ Woe to myself1” and
was that instant struck dea by a stone.

2. fas habet: cp. Leviticae, xix. 26.

3. religionibus adversa: a curicus aradox as applied to
Jews. Superstitio is sometimes used Tacitus, as here, ιο
denote any cult other than Roman or reek ι cp. A. xi. 15,
externae superstitiones .· apparently he has still enough belief
in the Roman religion to contrast it with superstition.

3, 4. concurrere ames: “As when to warn proud cities
wars appear w ed in the troubled sky.'' Compare the story
of the phantom ttle seen above Utrecht, in Motley's Dutch
Republie, pt. iv. chap. i.
