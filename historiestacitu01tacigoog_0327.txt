NOTE'S. V. CHAPS. 22, 23. 287

21. sig-no, the bugle call which marked the beginning of the
different viyiliae. The voces are the demand for and giving of
the word as the officer goes his rounds.

24. Lupia, the Lippe. The Roman trireme apparently

· drew only about 3 feet of water; otherwise the story would

be incredlble.
24. Velaedae: cp. iv, 61.

 

XXIII.

1. cupido incessit: incedere is often used with accusative
in Tacitus. Op. ii. 2, illum cupido incessit. The reading of M
is cupido inum-si incessit: perha s the scribe began to write
invasit. The late Mr. J. Η. ὃηίοῐιει suggested (Journal os
Philoloqy, vol. 16) cupido inanis incessit. Inanis would be
well justified by insitam qemi vanitatem below.

2. quaeque simplici, etc„ ‘ which were propelled by a single
row of oars ἐ Tacitus avoids the proper word mmwris
(μονήρης) with his usual aversion to technical terms.

4. quadragenosque: foUowed by ser in M, out of which
some make ferentium ; Wolff reads vexere (after Meiser),
making this and the three preceding words a parenthesis.

5. captae: Heraus and Wolff read accae (i.e. rowed)
whereby these boats would be distinguished from the others,
which were rigged like ‘ Liburnicae ’ (cp. ii. 16.)

sag. versicol. = cp. ii. 20, versicol. ⁸119qu indutus: Aen. viii.
660, (Galli) vio-qam lucent myndi&

6. spatium: the wide expanse of water (nearly six miles
broad) at the confluence of the Maas and L‘ek, the continua·
tion of the eastern R-hine. Tacitus means that the Maas,
after joining the Waal, is united by a side stream with the
Lek, and that the united streams flow together under the

name Mosa into the sea. Pliny, N. H. iv, 15, calls this
expanso ‘ Helinium ' : perhaps there is a temnant of the name

in the modern Hellevoet and Hellevoetsluis.
14. his, the Romans.

15. praevecti, ‘passing each other.'
· 16. trans Rhenum, across the N. or right branch of the
river.

18. nota arte: we read of Archidamus, during a Pelopon·
nesian invasion of Attica, employing this ‘ars’ against
Pericles (Thuc. ii. 13), and Hannibal treated Fabius’ estates
in the same way (Livy xxii. 23).
