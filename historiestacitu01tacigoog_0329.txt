‘NOTES V. emp. 26. 289

8. debebatur=deberetur. Cp. Cic. pro leye Manilia 17, si
Romae Pompeius privatus esset hoc tempore, tamen ad tantum
bellam ie crat diliyendus.

9. hostma: cp. iii. 70, antequam invicem hostilia coeptarent.

10. erga vespasianum: possibly Civilis became acquainted
with Vespasiam as Her'due sug este, when the latter was
commanding the 2nd legion in t e expedition to Britain of
43 A.D.: if this is εο, Civilis was no longer young.

12. epistulis ε the letter mentioned iv. 13.

16. flavianus: this is not strictly accurate: cp. ii. 86, iii.
4. What Civilis meant is that he had only fou ht for the

ῗὲξᾶθ cause which had been supported by all t e Flavian
ere.

So ends the story of the revolt. Apparently the Batavians
were not punished by any lose of those rights which they had
enjoyed: an honourable peace ended the rebellion. Tacitus
says in the Germania (39), ‘ M anet honos et antiquae societatie
insiync .· nam ‘nec tributis contemnuntur nec publicanae atterit .·
eoeempti oneribus et collationibus bellis reservamur.
